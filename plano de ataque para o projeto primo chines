Analysis of Current Code
What’s Correct

    Basic Architecture:

        The Barrel, Downloader, and Gateway classes exist and follow a client-server model.

        RMI is used for communication (e.g., BarrelServer creates an RMI registry).

    Core Indexing:

        Barrel has an inverted index (Map<String, Set<String>>) to map words to URLs.

        Downloader uses JSoup to fetch pages and extract links.

    Build and Run Scripts:

        build.sh compiles Java files with JSoup.

        run.sh starts the RMI registry and BarrelServer.

What’s Wrong/Missing

    Barrel Functionality:

        Missing Metadata: No storage of page titles, snippets, or incoming links (required for relevance ranking).

        No Partitioning: Words are not split into A–M/N–Z partitions (required for groups of 3 students).

        Redundancy: No reliable multicast to replicate data across Barrels.

    Downloader:

        No RMI Integration: Does not send extracted words/URLs to the Barrel via RMI.

        No Word Extraction: Only extracts links, not words from page content.

        No URL Queue: Does not add discovered URLs to a shared queue for further crawling.

    Gateway:

        Port Mismatch: Uses port 7777 instead of 8183 (as specified in the PDF).

        No Aggregation: Queries only one Barrel instead of aggregating results from multiple Barrels.

        No Failover: No retry logic if a Barrel fails.

    RMI Configuration:

        Registry Port: BarrelServer uses port 7777, conflicting with the PDF’s requirement for port 8183.

        Missing Methods: Index interface lacks methods for metadata, incoming links, and partitioning.

    Build/Run Issues:

        JSoup Version: pom.xml uses JSoup 1.18.3, but build.sh references 1.19.1.

        Classpath: run.sh assumes a JAR file that doesn’t exist (needs Maven packaging).

Future Steps

    Enhance the Barrel:

        Add pageMetadata (title, snippet) and incomingLinks to track relevance.

        Implement word partitioning (A–M/N–Z).

        Add reliable multicast to sync data across Barrels.

    Upgrade the Downloader:

        Extract words from page content (use doc.text()).

        Integrate RMI to send words/metadata/links to Barrels.

        Add discovered URLs to a shared queue (e.g., Barrel.putNew(url)).

    Fix the Gateway:

        Use port 8183 for Barrel communication.

        Aggregate results from all Barrels (e.g., A–M and N–Z partitions).

        Implement retry logic for failed Barrels.

    Improve RMI:

        Define an Index interface with methods for metadata, incoming links, and partitioning.

        Update BarrelServer to register multiple Barrels (e.g., barrel1, barrel2).

    Testing & Debugging:

        Test RMI communication between Downloader, Barrel, and Gateway.

        Validate relevance ranking (sort by incoming links).

        Ensure failover works (e.g., kill a Barrel and confirm Gateway retries).

Work Plan
Step	Task	Priority
1	Fix RMI port conflicts (use 8183 for Barrels).	High
2	Update Index interface with metadata/incoming link methods.	High
3	Modify Downloader to extract words and send data to Barrels via RMI.	High
4	Implement metadata and incoming links in Barrel.	High
5	Add word partitioning (A–M/N–Z) to Barrel.	Medium
6	Implement reliable multicast for Barrel replication.	Medium
7	Update Gateway to aggregate results from multiple Barrels.	Medium
8	Add retry/failover logic to Gateway.	Medium
9	Fix JSoup dependency version mismatch.	Low
10	Write integration tests for crawling, indexing, and searching.	High
Final Notes

    Collaboration: Split tasks between team members (e.g., one handles Barrel replication, another works on Gateway aggregation).

    Documentation: Update Javadoc for all new methods and classes.

    Demo: Prepare a test case where a user submits a URL, the system crawls it, and a search returns relevant results.
